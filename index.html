  <h2>Our Website</h2>
    <body>
      <p>We wanted to create a reliable website where students and tourists or citizens of denver could go to find information about Art in the city of denver. As you can see on our drop-down menu we have included information about statues in denver such as the blue bear in the Center Convention center and the Blue Bronco at the Denver International Airport. We also included music from John Denver and information about our very own Denver Art Museum. Finally, we aslo have information about the many forms of street art such as graffiti and murals. </p>
